# Voice-Based-Search-Engine
# Deepspeech2-3.docx -> It contains the entire step by step procedure for developing your own automatic speech recognition model using deepspeech
# Image_drive(1).ipynb -> contains the code for image captioning model
# final_captions_24_02_2020.csv -> contains the result of images and their description of images (Predicted from Image captioning model)
# final_compile.csv -> contains result comparision between original deepspeech model and my own deepspeech model
# text.ipynb -> contains the code for training own deepspeech model and in the end i used the final_captions_24_02_2020.csv result(Image captioning result) and queried my text as speech and got the result for my query.
# Following two are the tutorial video for installing deepspeech in your system and develop your own deepspeech model
